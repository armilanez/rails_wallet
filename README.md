# Rails Crypto Wallet

This is my first Ruby on Rails project being pushed with Git to GitHub. This is a pseudo-Cryptocurrency wallet.

Things to cover:

* This project is being built using Ruby version 3.0.0 (asdf)

* SQLite Database

* The Rails version of this project is 7.0.1

I hope you enjoy using it. No deadline for final version.
